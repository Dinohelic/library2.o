## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project is a React frontend application that connects directly to Google's Gemini API.

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is a React application built with TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS. It runs entirely in the browser and requires no build step for development, thanks to in-browser transpilation via Babel.

1.  **Set Up API Key**:
    You need to provide a Google Gemini API key for the AI features to work. This is done via an environment variable `API_KEY` that must be available in the execution environment where the app is running.

2.  **Run the application**:
    Simply serve the root directory using a static file server. All AI features will work directly in the browser.
